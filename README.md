# keep_or_discard
Organize all your photos and never lose track of them again. This app lets you quickly review every JPG in a chosen folder, tag each as keep or discard, and then—at the press of a button—moves the selected files (and any matching RAW originals) into tidy “keep” and “discard” folders for safe, organized storage.
